Blessings


Vers 1
We pray for blessings
We pray for peace comfort for family
Protection while we sleep
We pray for healing for prosperity
We pray for Your mighty hand
To ease our suffering
And all the while You hear each spoken need
Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things


Chorus 1
'Cause what if Your blessings come through raindrops
What if Your healing comes through tears
And what if a thousand sleepless nights
Are what it takes to know You're near
And what if trials of this life
Are Your mercies in disguise


Vers 2
We pray for wisdom
Your voice to hear
We cry in anger when we cannot feel You near
We doubt Your goodness
We doubt Your love
As if ev'ry promise from Your Word is not enough
And all the while You hear each desp'rate plea
And long that we'd have faith to believe


Bridge
When friends betray us
When darkness seems to win
We know that pain reminds this heart
That this is not this is not our home
It's not our home


Chorus 2
'Cause what if Your blessings come through raindrops
What if Your healing comes through tears
And what if a thousand sleepless nights
Are what it takes to know You're near
What if my greatest disappointments
Or the aching of this life
Is a revealing of a greater thirst
This world can't satisfy
And what if trials of this life
The rain the storms the hardest nights
Are Your mercies in disguise
